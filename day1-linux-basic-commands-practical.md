# Day 1 – Linux Basic Commands (Practical)

## Objective
The objective of this practical is to
understand and practice basic Linux commands
used in cybersecurity environments.

I performed this practical using
Ubuntu Linux on Windows (WSL).

## Environment Used
- Operating System: Windows
- Linux Platform: Ubuntu (WSL)
- Tool: Linux Terminal

## Commands Practiced

### 1. pwd
This command shows the current working directory.

### 2. ls
This command lists files and folders
present in the current directory.

### 3. whoami
This command displays the username
of the currently logged-in user.

### 4. date
This command shows the current system
date and time.

### 5. uname -a
This command displays detailed system
information such as kernel version
and system architecture.

## Why These Commands Are Important in Cybersecurity
Before analyzing a system, a cybersecurity
professional must know:
- Where they are working (directory)
- Which user is logged in
- What system and kernel is running

These commands help in system identification
and environment verification.

## Observations
I was able to successfully execute all
commands in the Linux terminal and
observe system-related information.

## What I Learned
- How to use a Linux terminal
- How to identify system details
- Why basic Linux commands are important
  in cybersecurity investigations

## Conclusion
This practical helped me understand
the Linux environment, which is a
core requirement for cybersecurity roles.
